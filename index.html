			What ChairsRUs is all about
		</h1>
		<p>
			Here at ChairsRUs we strive to make the least functional and/or uncomfortable chairs possible.
			We sell everything from <span class="chair">oddly cut tree stumps to thrones made out of snow.</span>
			We will even make a chair that you designed as long as its not too funcional. Don't forget that we are
			here to make you miserable.
